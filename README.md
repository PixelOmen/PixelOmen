# Bio

Experienced professional with 14 years in TV/Film post-production and a self-taught programmer for over 6 years. My journey in post-production has honed my detail-oriented and analytical skills, which have been instrumental in my self-directed programming education. Driven by a passion for solving problems and a relentless pursuit of knowledge, I have developed a strong foundation in programming through persistent self-study and practical application. Eager to apply my diverse skill set in a new domain, I am looking for opportunities to contribute to and grow within the tech industry. I am particularly interested in roles that challenge me to learn and innovate, as I continue to evolve my capabilities in software development.
